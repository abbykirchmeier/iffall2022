            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p> Steamed layer cake is a popular SouthEast Asian dessert that can be made in many flavors – Pandan and coconut, ube and coconut, mung bean and coconut to name a few. Today, I’ll be showing you how to make pandan and mung bean flavor steamed layered cake. This steamed layered cake will have 9 layers! WOWZA. One of the most eye catching dessert but also a very time consuming one since it takes a lot of time to cook each layer. Very tedious...but worth the glory. There’s a lot of recipes for this dessert depending on what texture you want. So if you like a peel-able, thinner layers, chewy, bouncy, but also soft texture, then this recipe is for you. </p>

                <li>In a pot add in the soaked mung beans and 1 cup of water. Let it come to a slight boil and then turn down the heat to slowly cook and steam the mung beans until they are soft. This should take about 15- 20 minutes. </li>
                <li> Then, add it to a blender. Blend well. The mung bean puree should add up to 1 cup. If not, add water until it reaches 1 cup. Set aside. </li>

                <li>Get your steamer ready.  The water should be boiling before steaming.</li>
                <li>Get your 9x3 inch round pan or 9x9 square pan and brush it with 1 tbsp of neutral oil. Place it in the steamer to warm up the pan for about 3-5 minutes or so.</li>

            <h1>Recipe Websites</h1>
            <h2> <a href="https://www.yummly.com/">Yummly</a></h2>
            <p> When you first enter Yummly's website you're presented with options for cuisine type, which may helpful to narrow down options for users who are browsing for meals to cook. The layout of each recipe is also very user freindly begginging with a picture, number of ingredients, and total time to make listed at the begginging of the page. </p>
            <h2> <a href="https://www.delish.com/">Delish</a></h2>
            <p> Rather organizing dishes by cuisine type, Delish organizes recipes by recommendation – from delish, other users, and recommendation for the season (ex. pumpkin spice recipes for fall). I think there are pros and cons to this method. I think users appreciate hearing from those who are more experienced wether that be professional foodies at Delish or just people who've made that dish before. However, I think it makes it more difficult for users who know what the are looking, to find the recipe they want. The lack of seearch bar on the home page, adds to that users difficulties. </p>
            <h2><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/">Bon Appetit</a></h2> 
            <p> Bon Appetit's site cleverly uses a double-collum and scroll features to showcase more recipes to their users. This makes it more likely a user will find what they're looking for without having to spend too much time on the site. The dish photos are also very visually appealing and cohesive. They all have vibrant colors and bright lighting, which contributes to the sites overall clean and unified look, </p>

            <h1>Non-Recipe Websites</h1>
            <h2> <a href="https://www.subtropicstudios.com/">Subtropic Studio</a></h2>
            <p> This digtial and AR design studio showcased their projects in a fast paced video on the landing page. I think this would be a cool to mimic this for the recipe page and play a video of somone baking the cake. I feel like it gives a nice introduction to the user before getting to the recipe.</p>
            <h2> <a href="https://www.superlist.com/">Superlist</a></h2>
            <p> Superlist integrates a drag feature that moves with your curser. I think this would be a fun and interactive way to swtich from image of a recipe to the actual ingrediates, or maybe swipe between two images</p>
            <h2><a href="https://www.ideo.com/blog">The ocotopus</a></h2> 
            <p> The Ocotopus, Ideo's design blog, has a very clean and structured organization, that I think is essential on recipe webpages. I think mimicing the collum style and blocking would be a successful feature to integrate into my own webapge. </p>
