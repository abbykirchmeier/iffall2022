                <p >[Intro] </p>
                <p> Hey, hey, hey </p> 
                <p> (9th Wonder) Hi, hey, hey, hey  </p>
                <p> And on (I hear it's like—), and on (I hear it's kinda like—) </p> 
                <br>
                <p> [Verse 1] </p>
                <p> Hey, I heard they got nice cars up in Heaven </p> 
                <p> Free liquor out the bar and the brightest f*ckin' stars up in Heaven </p>
                <p> Not worry 'bout someone fightin' 'cause everything just at peace  </p> 
                <p> Heard the streets paved with gold, the women all gorgeous  </p>
                <p> You just float, can't even feel where the floor is </p> 
                <p> I heard Heaven got a brand new venue </p>
                <p> Next to that restaurant, you love their menu </p> 
                <p> And everything free, so everyone cool </p>
                <p> Look out any window, it's an incredible view </p> 
                <p> Everyone you speak to always tellin' you the truth </p>
                <p> And it's only good shit when you gettin' all your news </p> 
                <p> Ooh, I imagine that </p>
                <p> Just a place that we can kick it, be happy at </p> 
                <p> Satisfaction or maybe I'm dreamin' </p>
                <p> Tell you what it's like when I see it </p> 
                <br>
                <p> [Chorus] </p>
                <p> If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?</p>
                <p> Please, I'm really tryin' to know </p> 
                <p> 'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done </p>
                <p> Shit, I'm just tryin' to go </p>
                <p> If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?</p>
                <p> Please, I'm really tryin' to know </p> 
                <p> 'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done </p>
                <p> Shit, I'm just tryin' to go </p>
                <br>
                <p> [Verse 2] </p>
                <p> I heard ain't nobody famous up in Heaven, everybody the same </p>
                <p> Just kick it up there in Heaven 'cause nobody goin' change</p>
                <p> Nobody can complain, the parties are all insane </p>
                <p> The people all know your name, shit, you entertain </p>
                <p> See everybody you want, always keepin' in touch </p>
                <p> And go and chill by yourself when everything get too much </p>
                <p> Never a f*ckin' rush, you there for a million plus </p>
                <p> You probably got a Mercedes, but always could take the bus </p>
                <p> So f*ck, that's what Heaven's like, I guess I think it is</p>
                <p> But come to think of it, I've been drinkin' shit, I don't know the truth </p>
                <p> This is what I imagined when I was standin' in the booth, haha</p>
                <br>
                <p> [Chorus] </p>
                <p> If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?</p>
                <p> Please, I'm really tryin' to know </p> 
                <p> 'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done </p>
                <p> Shit, I'm just tryin' to go </p>
                <p> If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?</p>
                <p> Please, I'm really tryin' to know </p> 
                <p> 'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done </p>
                <p> Shit, I'm just tryin' to go </p>
